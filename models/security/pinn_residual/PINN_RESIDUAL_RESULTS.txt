PINN-RESIDUAL ANOMALY DETECTION RESULTS
================================================================================

METHODOLOGY:
1. Load trained PINN dynamics model (models/euroc_pinn.pth)
2. Compute residuals: actual_next - pinn_predicted_next
3. Extract multi-scale features from RESIDUALS (not raw data)
4. Train IsolationForest on residual features
5. Detect anomalies as physics violations

HYPOTHESIS:
- Attacks cause PHYSICS VIOLATIONS, not just statistical anomalies
- PINN predicts expected physics -> attacks cause residual spikes
- Bias attacks should be detectable (violate dynamics consistency)

RESULTS (LOSO-CV):
- Average FPR: 14.0%
- Overall Recall: 11.2%

Per-Attack Type:
  noise          : 9.5%
  bias           : 0.1%
  drift          : 29.4%
  jump           : 14.4%
  oscillation    : 2.7%

COMPARISON WITH RAW FEATURES:
                    Raw Features    PINN Residuals
  Overall Recall:      22.7%          11.2%
  Bias Recall:          3.1%          0.1%
  FPR:                  6.5%          14.0%

CONCLUSION: PINN-residual approach needs more work.
