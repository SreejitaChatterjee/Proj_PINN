METHODOLOGY:
- Leave-One-Sequence-Out Cross-Validation (NO temporal leakage)
- Contamination set from domain knowledge (NOT tuned on attacks)
- Per-attack ROC/PR curves with AUC
- Stealth attack testing (hard negatives)

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PUBLICATION
================================================================================

1. CONSERVATIVE CLAIMS:
   - Report WORST-CASE recall, not average
   - Include standard deviation across folds
   - Qualify: 'on synthetic EuRoC-based attacks'

2. LIMITATIONS TO ACKNOWLEDGE:
   - Single dataset (EuRoC)
   - Synthetic attack generation
   - Stealth attack vulnerability
   - Cross-dataset validation pending

3. HONEST ASSESSMENT:
   Best config (c=0.05):
     Average Recall: 22.7% +/- 3.7%
     Worst-Case Recall: 0.0%
     FPR: 6.5%
     Stealth Recall: 32.5%

   These numbers are LOWER than previous claims but CREDIBLE.
