ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================================================================

WHY NOISE WORKS (60% recall):
- Noise INCREASES variance at all timescales
- std_w* features directly measure this
- Large magnitude noise exceeds normal variance significantly

WHY BIAS FAILS (3% recall):
- Bias is CONSTANT OFFSET
- Does NOT change variance (std features unchanged)
- Mean shift is within normal operating range
- Multi-scale features are BLIND to constant offsets

WHY 0.25x FAILS (3% recall):
- Perturbations are smaller than normal variation
- Z-scores < 1 (within 1 std of normal)
- Statistically indistinguishable from normal data

WHY CROSS-DATASET FAILS (3.3% recall):
- EuRoC and PADRE have different:
  - Sensor characteristics
  - Flight dynamics
  - State representations
  - Sampling rates
- Features trained on EuRoC are MEANINGLESS for PADRE

FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATION:
Multi-scale statistical features can only detect attacks that
CHANGE STATISTICAL PROPERTIES (variance, autocorrelation).
They CANNOT detect:
- Constant offsets (bias)
- Slow drifts (within variance)
- Coordinated attacks (maintain statistics)

SOLUTION: PHYSICS-BASED DETECTION
Instead of detecting statistical anomalies in raw data,
detect PHYSICS VIOLATIONS:
1. Use PINN to predict expected next state
2. Compute residual = actual - predicted
3. Residuals should be near-zero for normal data
4. ANY attack causes physics violation -> residual spike
5. Apply anomaly detection to residuals

This approach should:
- Detect bias (violates dynamics)
- Detect low-magnitude attacks (still violate physics)
- Generalize across platforms (physics is universal)
