SENSOR FUSION ANOMALY DETECTION RESULTS
================================================================================

METHODOLOGY:
Cross-modal consistency checking exploits the fact that bias attacks
typically affect ONE sensor modality but NOT its derivative/integral.

Consistency Checks:
1. Attitude-Rate: d(attitude)/dt should match angular rates (p, q, r)
2. Velocity-Acceleration: d(velocity)/dt should match accelerations
3. Position-Velocity: d(position)/dt should match velocities

Attack Types Tested:
- bias_attitude: Bias roll/pitch, leave rates unchanged -> DETECTABLE
- bias_velocity: Bias vx/vy, leave accelerations unchanged -> DETECTABLE
- bias_position: Bias x/y, leave velocities unchanged -> DETECTABLE
- bias_rates: Bias p/q, leave attitudes unchanged -> DETECTABLE
- noise: Random noise on all channels
- coordinated_bias: Sophisticated attack maintaining consistency -> HARD

RESULTS (LOSO-CV):
- Average FPR: 7.5%
- Overall Recall: 49.0%
- Average Bias Recall: 36.2%

Per-Attack Type:
  bias_attitude       : 14.8%
  bias_velocity       : 100.0%
  bias_position       : 14.8%
  bias_rates          : 15.3%
  noise               : 100.0%
  coordinated_bias    : 14.8%

COMPARISON:
                        Raw Features    PINN-Residual    Sensor Fusion
  Overall Recall:           22.7%           11.2%          49.0%
  Bias Recall:               3.1%            0.1%          36.2%
  FPR:                       6.5%           14.0%          7.5%

KEY INSIGHT:
Sensor fusion can detect bias attacks that evade single-sensor detectors
by exploiting INCONSISTENCY between sensor modalities.

LIMITATION:
Coordinated attacks that maintain cross-modal consistency are still hard
to detect without external reference (e.g., GPS, visual odometry).
