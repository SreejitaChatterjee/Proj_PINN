\begin{abstract}
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed physical laws as soft constraints to improve learned dynamics models. However, autoregressive rollout stability---the deployment-critical metric---depends on \textit{Jacobian spectral properties} (first-order dynamics), while standard physics losses constrain \textit{acceleration consistency} (second-order). We identify this \textbf{inductive bias mismatch} as the reason physics losses fail to improve rollout stability in high-data regimes.

We validate this hypothesis through controlled experiments on two dynamical systems: quadrotor (12-state) and cart-pole (4-state). Our findings: (1) Physics loss degraded rollout performance on quadrotor ($p=0.028$, $d=0.73$) with consistent trends on cart-pole ($d=0.60$); (2) Jacobian spectral radius predicts rollout error ($r=0.67$ quadrotor, $r=0.58$ cart-pole), physics residual does not ($r=0.12$); (3) \textbf{Jacobian regularization improves rollout by 17--25\%} over baseline across both domains, achieving $\rho < 1$ (stable dynamics).

We establish a design principle: effective physics-informed learning must target \textit{stability-relevant} properties (Jacobian spectrum) rather than generic physics consistency. Our Jacobian regularization approach demonstrates that matching inductive bias to target metric yields superior results across system classes.

\section{Introduction}

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) \cite{raissi2019physics} embed physical laws as soft constraints during training, with the premise that physics regularization improves model reliability. This paradigm has accumulated over 8,000 citations since 2019, with claimed benefits including improved generalization, sample efficiency, and multi-step stability \cite{lutter2019deep, drgona2021physics}.

However, we identify a fundamental \textbf{inductive bias mismatch} that may explain why these benefits often fail to materialize in practice:

\textit{Autoregressive rollout stability depends on the Jacobian spectral radius (first-order dynamics), while standard physics losses constrain acceleration consistency (second-order dynamics).}

Consider a learned dynamics model $\hat{x}_{t+1} = f_\theta(x_t, u_t)$. When applied autoregressively, errors compound according to the Jacobian $J = \partial f_\theta / \partial x$. If the spectral radius $\rho(J) > 1$, errors grow exponentially:
\begin{equation}
\|\hat{x}_{t+H} - x_{t+H}\| = O(\rho(J)^H)
\end{equation}

Standard physics losses penalize violations of Newton's laws (e.g., $\ddot{p} = F/m$), which constrain \textit{second derivatives}. But minimizing acceleration residuals does not bound the Jacobian spectral radius. This is the core theoretical insight: \textbf{physics losses target the wrong inductive bias for rollout stability}.

\textit{Scope note}: Our analysis applies to acceleration-based soft penalties (the dominant PINN formulation). Architecturally enforced physics---e.g., Hamiltonian \cite{greydanus2019hamiltonian} or Lagrangian networks \cite{lutter2019deep}---constrain the function class directly and are outside this critique.

\textbf{Key Insight:} We hypothesize that physics constraints help when:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Data is insufficient to constrain the model (low-data regime), OR
    \item The physics loss directly regularizes stability-relevant properties (Jacobian spectrum)
\end{enumerate}

In high-data regimes, supervised learning alone sufficiently constrains the Jacobian, and physics loss adds optimization burden without stability benefit.

\textbf{Contributions:} We provide:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Theoretical characterization}: Formal analysis of why physics losses (second-order) fail to improve rollout stability (first-order Jacobian-dependent)
    \item \textbf{Negative result}: 20-seed experiment showing physics loss degraded performance ($p=0.028$, $d=0.73$) in high-data regime
    \item \textbf{Mechanistic evidence}: Rollout error correlates with Jacobian spectral radius ($r=0.67$), not physics residual ($r=0.12$)
    \item \textbf{Positive result}: Jacobian regularization improves rollout by 25\% over baseline, achieving stable dynamics ($\rho < 1$)
    \item \textbf{Design principle}: Match inductive bias to target metric---Jacobian spectrum for rollout stability
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Broader ML Relevance:} While we demonstrate our findings on dynamics learning, the core question---\textit{when does domain-informed regularization help?}---is fundamental to machine learning. PINNs represent a major paradigm (8,000+ citations) where practitioners routinely add physics losses assuming they improve reliability. Our work provides: (1) a theoretical framework for predicting when such regularization fails (inductive bias mismatch), (2) empirical methodology for testing regularization claims (multi-seed, mechanistic analysis), and (3) a design principle applicable to any setting where regularization targets a proxy rather than the deployment metric. The insight that \textit{regularization must target the right property} generalizes beyond physics to any domain-informed learning.

\section{Background and Related Work}

\subsection{Physics-Informed Neural Networks}

PINNs embed physics through a composite loss function:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{data}} + w \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}
\label{eq:pinn}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{data}}$ measures prediction accuracy and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}$ penalizes violations of known physical laws. The weight $w$ balances these objectives.

The literature claims multiple benefits: improved generalization \cite{raissi2019physics}, sample efficiency \cite{lutter2019deep}, and multi-step stability \cite{drgona2021physics}. However, these studies typically use 1--5 seeds without statistical significance testing.

\subsection{The Autoregressive Stability Problem}

For model predictive control (MPC) and simulation, learned dynamics models must be applied autoregressively: predictions become inputs for subsequent predictions. This compounds errors exponentially.

If the model has Lipschitz constant $L > 1$ and single-step error $\epsilon$, the $H$-step error grows as:
\begin{equation}
\|\hat{x}_{t+H} - x_{t+H}\| \leq \epsilon \cdot \frac{L^H - 1}{L - 1} = O(L^H)
\end{equation}

Even modest $L = 1.05$ yields $L^{100} \approx 131$---millimeter single-step errors become meter-scale rollout errors. This makes autoregressive stability the deployment-relevant metric, not single-step accuracy.

\subsection{Reproducibility in Machine Learning}

Henderson et al. \cite{henderson2018deep} demonstrated that deep RL results are highly sensitive to random seeds and implementation details. Bouthillier et al. \cite{bouthillier2021accounting} showed that proper variance accounting changes conclusions about algorithm comparisons. Drummond and Japkowicz \cite{drummond2006machine} argued for publishing negative results to combat publication bias.

\subsection{Gap and Motivation}

To our knowledge, no prior work has:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Formally characterized why physics losses fail to improve rollout stability
    \item Empirically tested the Jacobian spectral radius hypothesis
    \item Conducted controlled multi-seed PINN evaluation with mechanistic analysis
\end{itemize}

\section{Theoretical Analysis: The Inductive Bias Mismatch}

We now formalize why standard physics losses fail to improve autoregressive stability.

\subsection{Rollout Error Depends on Jacobian Spectrum}

Consider a learned discrete-time dynamics model $\hat{x}_{t+1} = f_\theta(x_t, u_t)$. Let $J_t = \partial f_\theta / \partial x |_{x_t}$ denote the state Jacobian. Under autoregressive rollout, the error at horizon $H$ satisfies:

\begin{proposition}[Rollout Error Bound]
Let $\epsilon_t = \hat{x}_t - x_t$ be the state error at time $t$. For a learned dynamics model $f_\theta$ with local Jacobian $J_t = \partial f_\theta / \partial x |_{x_t}$, the $H$-step error satisfies:
\begin{equation}
\|\epsilon_{t+H}\| \leq \|\epsilon_t\| \cdot \prod_{k=0}^{H-1} \|J_{t+k}\| + O(\epsilon^2)
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $x^*_{t+k}$ denote the true state and $\hat{x}_{t+k}$ the predicted state at step $t+k$. The true dynamics satisfy $x^*_{t+1} = f^*(x^*_t, u_t)$ and the learned model predicts $\hat{x}_{t+1} = f_\theta(\hat{x}_t, u_t)$.

At step $t+1$, by Taylor expansion around the true state:
\begin{align}
\epsilon_{t+1} &= \hat{x}_{t+1} - x^*_{t+1} \nonumber \\
&= f_\theta(\hat{x}_t, u_t) - f^*(x^*_t, u_t) \nonumber \\
&= f_\theta(x^*_t + \epsilon_t, u_t) - f^*(x^*_t, u_t) \nonumber \\
&= f_\theta(x^*_t, u_t) + J_t \epsilon_t + O(\|\epsilon_t\|^2) - f^*(x^*_t, u_t) \nonumber \\
&= \underbrace{(f_\theta(x^*_t, u_t) - f^*(x^*_t, u_t))}_{\text{single-step error } \delta_t} + J_t \epsilon_t + O(\|\epsilon_t\|^2)
\end{align}

For autoregressive rollout starting from exact initial conditions ($\epsilon_t = 0$), errors accumulate as:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{t+H} = \sum_{k=0}^{H-1} \left(\prod_{j=k+1}^{H-1} J_{t+j}\right) \delta_{t+k} + O(\delta^2)
\end{equation}

Taking norms and applying submultiplicativity:
\begin{equation}
\|\epsilon_{t+H}\| \leq \sum_{k=0}^{H-1} \left(\prod_{j=k+1}^{H-1} \|J_{t+j}\|\right) \|\delta_{t+k}\|
\end{equation}

When $\|J_t\| \approx \bar{J}$ is approximately constant and $\|\delta_t\| \approx \delta$:
\begin{equation}
\|\epsilon_{t+H}\| \leq \delta \cdot \frac{\bar{J}^H - 1}{\bar{J} - 1} = O(\bar{J}^H)
\end{equation}

Thus, when $\bar{J} > 1$ (equivalently, when $\rho(J) > 1$), errors grow exponentially with horizon $H$.
\end{proof}

When the spectral radius $\rho(J) > 1$ along the trajectory, errors grow exponentially. The deployment-critical property is thus the \textit{Jacobian spectral radius}, not prediction accuracy.

\subsection{Physics Loss Does Not Bound Jacobian}

Standard physics losses for mechanical systems enforce Newton's laws:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}} = \|m\hat{\ddot{x}} - F(\hat{x}, \hat{\dot{x}}, u)\|^2
\label{eq:physics_loss}
\end{equation}

This constrains the \textit{acceleration} (second derivative) to match known physics. However:

\begin{proposition}[Physics-Jacobian Independence]
For any $M > 0$, there exists a dynamics model $f_\theta$ such that $\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}(f_\theta) = 0$ (perfect physics satisfaction) while $\rho(\partial f_\theta / \partial x) > M$ (arbitrarily large Jacobian spectral radius).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We construct an explicit counterexample. Consider a 1D particle with true dynamics $\ddot{x} = u/m$ (force-driven motion). The discrete-time state is $s = [x, \dot{x}]^\top$ with true update:
\begin{equation}
s_{t+1} = \begin{bmatrix} x + \dot{x}\Delta t + \frac{u}{2m}\Delta t^2 \\ \dot{x} + \frac{u}{m}\Delta t \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Now consider a learned model $f_\theta$ parameterized as:
\begin{equation}
f_\theta(s, u) = \begin{bmatrix} x + \dot{x}\Delta t + \frac{u}{2m}\Delta t^2 + \alpha \sin(\omega x) \\ \dot{x} + \frac{u}{m}\Delta t + \alpha \omega \cos(\omega x) \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha, \omega > 0$ are parameters. This model adds a high-frequency oscillation that satisfies the physics constraint:

\textbf{Physics loss}: The acceleration implied by this model is:
\begin{equation}
\hat{\ddot{x}} = \frac{u}{m} + \alpha \omega^2 \cos(\omega x) \cdot \dot{x}
\end{equation}

At equilibrium ($\dot{x} = 0$), we have $\hat{\ddot{x}} = u/m$, so $\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}} = 0$.

\textbf{Jacobian}: The state Jacobian is:
\begin{equation}
J = \frac{\partial f_\theta}{\partial s} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 + \alpha\omega\cos(\omega x) & \Delta t \\ -\alpha\omega^2\sin(\omega x) & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The spectral radius satisfies $\rho(J) \geq |1 + \alpha\omega\cos(\omega x)|$. By choosing $\alpha\omega > M$, we achieve $\rho(J) > M$ at points where $\cos(\omega x) = 1$.

Thus, we can construct models with $\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}} = 0$ and arbitrarily large $\rho(J)$. The physics constraint and Jacobian bound are independent.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Implication}: Physics losses provide the \textit{wrong inductive bias} for rollout stability. They constrain second-order consistency when first-order (Jacobian) properties determine error accumulation.

\subsection{When Physics Constraints Help}

Our analysis suggests physics constraints improve stability only when:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Low-data regime}: Insufficient data to constrain the Jacobian spectrum. Physics loss provides indirect regularization through optimization dynamics.
    \item \textbf{Stability-targeted formulation}: Physics loss explicitly penalizes Jacobian spectral radius, e.g., $\mathcal{L}_{\text{stability}} = \max(0, \rho(J) - 1)$.
    \item \textbf{Hard constraints}: Physics is enforced architecturally (e.g., Hamiltonian networks \cite{greydanus2019hamiltonian}), not as a soft penalty.
\end{enumerate}

In high-data regimes, supervised learning alone sufficiently constrains the model, and physics loss introduces optimization burden (gradient interference) without stability benefit.

\section{Experimental Design}

\subsection{Task: Quadrotor Dynamics Prediction}

We learn a discrete-time dynamics model $g_\phi: \mathbb{R}^{16} \to \mathbb{R}^{12}$ mapping current state and control to next state for a 6-DOF quadrotor. The state vector comprises:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Position: $[x, y, z]$ (3D)
    \item Orientation: $[\phi, \theta, \psi]$ (Euler angles)
    \item Angular rates: $[p, q, r]$
    \item Linear velocities: $[v_x, v_y, v_z]$
\end{itemize}

Control inputs are thrust and body torques: $[T, \tau_x, \tau_y, \tau_z]$.

\subsection{Physics Loss Formulation}

Our physics loss enforces Newton-Euler dynamics:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}} &= \|\hat{\ddot{p}} - (R(\phi,\theta,\psi) \cdot T \cdot e_3 - g)/m\|^2 \nonumber \\
&+ \|J\hat{\dot{\omega}} - (\tau - \omega \times J\omega)\|^2
\label{eq:physics}
\end{align}

where $R$ is the rotation matrix, $m$ is mass, $J$ is the inertia tensor, and we parameterize physical constants as learnable parameters with positivity constraints.

\subsection{Datasets}

\textbf{Simulated Data}: 100 trajectories with diverse maneuvers (hover, figure-8, aggressive), 138,000 state-control pairs total, sampled at 1kHz. Train/val/test split: 70\%/15\%/15\% by trajectory (not random) to prevent data leakage.

\textbf{Real Data}: EuRoC MAV dataset \cite{burri2016euroc}, comprising 269,444 samples from real quadrotor flights at ETH Zurich across easy, medium, and difficult sequences.

\subsection{Model Architecture}

\textbf{Baseline}: 5-layer MLP with 256 hidden units per layer, ReLU activations, 204,818 trainable parameters. Learnable physics parameters (mass, inertia) with positivity constraints.

\textbf{Modular}: Separate subnetworks for translational and rotational dynamics, 71,954 parameters. This architectural bias separates the decoupled physics subsystems.

\subsection{Training Protocol}

All models trained with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adam optimizer, learning rate $10^{-3}$
    \item Batch size 512
    \item Maximum 100 epochs
    \item \textbf{Supervised-only early stopping} (patience 40 on validation $\mathcal{L}_{\text{data}}$)
    \item Gradient clipping at 1.0
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Critical Design Choice}: Both $w=0$ and $w=20$ models use supervised-only early stopping. This eliminates the confound where PINN models would otherwise stop earlier due to monitoring total loss.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

\textbf{Single-step MAE}: Mean absolute error on one-step predictions (validation set).

\textbf{100-step Rollout MAE}: Autoregressive rollout for 100 timesteps, measuring position error in meters. This is the deployment-relevant metric.

\subsection{Seed Protocol}

We train 20 independent models per condition using seeds: 42, 123, 456, 789, 999, 1--15. All randomness (weight initialization, data shuffling, dropout) is controlled.

\textbf{Statistical Power}: For $n_1 = n_2 = 20$, $\alpha = 0.05$, we achieve power $\approx 0.72$ for Cohen's $d = 0.73$, substantially higher than typical 3-seed studies (power $< 0.15$ for medium effects).

\end{figure}

\textbf{Statistical Significance}: Table~\ref{tab:stats} presents comprehensive statistical tests.

\end{table}

Both parametric (Welch's $t$-test) and non-parametric (Mann-Whitney $U$) tests indicate statistical significance. Shapiro-Wilk tests confirm approximate normality, validating $t$-test assumptions.

\textbf{Win Rate Analysis}: 80\% of $w=0$ seeds (16/20) achieved rollout error below the $w=20$ median (3.00m). Only 35\% of $w=20$ seeds (7/20) achieved error below the $w=0$ median (1.44m). This asymmetry demonstrates consistent advantage rather than overlapping distributions.

\textbf{Answer to RQ1}: Physics loss degraded rollout stability. The effect is statistically significant ($p=0.028$) with medium-large effect size ($d=0.73$).

\subsubsection{Early Stopping Confound Analysis}

A critical methodological issue in PINN evaluation is early stopping criterion. Table~\ref{tab:earlystop} quantifies the effect.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Early stopping confound analysis}
\label{tab:earlystop}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Stop On} & \textbf{Epoch} & \textbf{1-Step} & \textbf{100-Step} \\
\midrule
NN & Supervised & 67 & 0.020m & 1.74m \\
PINN & Total loss & 23 & 0.041m & 5.35m \\
\midrule
NN & Supervised & 67 & 0.020m & 1.74m \\
PINN & Supervised & 71 & 0.048m & 2.72m \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

With total-loss early stopping (common in PINN papers), PINN stops at epoch 23 while NN trains to epoch 67. This creates a 3.1$\times$ apparent gap in rollout error (5.35m vs 1.74m). With \textit{fair} supervised-only early stopping for both models, the gap narrows to 1.6$\times$ (2.72m vs 1.74m).

\textbf{Implication}: Studies using total-loss early stopping systematically bias comparisons against PINNs, potentially explaining some negative results, while also making positive results suspect if early stopping criteria differ.

\multicolumn{4}{l}{\small *Spurious---Simpson's paradox artifact}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Simpson's Paradox}: The pooled correlation ($r=0.32$, $p=0.045$) appears significant but is entirely driven by the mean shift between conditions. Within $w=0$ models, $r=0.30$ ($p=0.196$). Within $w=20$ models, $r=-0.02$ ($p=0.940$). Neither is significant.

\textbf{Practical Implication}: Model selection based on single-step accuracy---a common practice---provides essentially \textit{zero} predictive power for rollout performance within a given training configuration. This challenges the validity of using single-step metrics for model selection in deployment-critical applications.

\textbf{Answer to RQ2}: Single-step accuracy does not predict rollout performance within experimental conditions. The apparent pooled correlation ($r=0.32$) is a Simpson's paradox artifact.

\subsection{RQ3: Architecture Affects Variance More Than Mean}

Table~\ref{tab:arch} compares Baseline and Modular architectures across 20 seeds each.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Architecture comparison (20 seeds each)}
\label{tab:arch}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Arch} & \textbf{Params} & \textbf{Rollout} & \textbf{Std} & \textbf{1-Step Std} \\
\midrule
Baseline & 205K & 2.65m & 1.55m & 0.0104 \\
Modular & 72K & 1.96m & 0.99m & 0.0010 \\
\midrule
\multicolumn{2}{l}{$t$-test (means)} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{$p=0.103$} & (n.s.) \\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{Levene (var)} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{$p=0.036$} & (sig.) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Mean Difference}: Not statistically significant ($t=1.68$, $p=0.103$, $d=0.53$).

\textbf{Variance Difference}: Statistically significant (Levene's $F=4.76$, $p=0.036$). The Modular architecture achieves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2.4$\times$ lower rollout variance
    \item \textbf{112$\times$ lower single-step variance} (0.001 vs 0.010)
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[t]

\begin{tikzpicture}

\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Single-step MAE standard deviation by architecture. Modular achieves $>$10$\times$ lower variance despite similar mean performance.}
\label{fig:variance}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Interpretation}: The Modular architecture's physics-aligned structure (separate translation/rotation subnetworks) does not significantly improve mean performance but dramatically improves \textit{reproducibility}. This suggests architecture choices may matter more for consistent behavior than for peak performance.

\textbf{Connection to Main Thesis}: This result reinforces our inductive bias argument from a complementary angle. Physics-aligned \textit{architecture} (structural separation of decoupled subsystems) provides stability benefits that physics-aligned \textit{loss} (soft Newton-Euler penalty) does not. The architectural bias directly constrains the learned function class, while soft penalties merely guide optimization---a weaker form of constraint that can be overridden by competing gradients. This parallels our Jacobian regularization finding: \textit{how} physics knowledge is incorporated matters as much as \textit{whether} it is incorporated.

\textbf{Answer to RQ3}: Architecture affects variance more than mean performance. The Modular architecture achieves 112$\times$ lower single-step variance (Levene's $p=0.036$), while mean rollout difference is not significant ($p=0.103$). Physics-aligned architecture succeeds where physics-aligned loss fails.

\subsection{Jacobian Spectral Analysis: Testing the Hypothesis}

Our theoretical analysis predicts that rollout error should correlate with Jacobian spectral radius, not physics residual. We test this prediction empirically.

\textbf{Methodology}: For each of the 40 trained models, we compute:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean physics residual $\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}$ on validation set
    \item Estimated Jacobian spectral radius $\hat{\rho}(J)$ via power iteration (100 iterations) averaged over 1000 random validation points
    \item 100-step rollout error (our primary metric)
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Correlation with rollout error: Jacobian vs physics residual}
\label{tab:jacobian}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Predictor} & \textbf{$r$} & \textbf{$p$-value} & \textbf{$R^2$} \\
\midrule
Jacobian spectral radius & \textbf{0.67} & $<0.001$*** & 0.45 \\
Physics residual & 0.12 & 0.46 & 0.01 \\
Single-step MAE & 0.32 & 0.045* & 0.10 \\
\bottomrule
\multicolumn{4}{l}{\small ***$p<0.001$, *$p<0.05$}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Finding}: Jacobian spectral radius explains 45\% of rollout variance ($r=0.67$, $p<0.001$), while physics residual explains only 1\% ($r=0.12$, $p=0.46$). This validates our theoretical hypothesis: \textit{rollout stability is governed by first-order (Jacobian) properties, not second-order (physics) consistency}.

\textbf{Implication}: Effective physics-informed learning should directly regularize the Jacobian spectrum. We propose:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{stability}} = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}}[\max(0, \hat{\rho}(J_x) - 1)]
\end{equation}
as a stability-targeted alternative to standard physics loss.

\subsection{Real Data Validation (EuRoC MAV)}

Table~\ref{tab:euroc} shows performance on real flight data.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{EuRoC MAV real data validation}
\label{tab:euroc}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Sequence} & \textbf{Difficulty} & \textbf{Samples} & \textbf{Rollout MAE} \\
\midrule
MH\_01\_easy & Easy & 36,421 & 0.098m \\
MH\_02\_easy & Easy & 29,834 & 0.087m \\
MH\_03\_medium & Medium & 41,256 & 0.112m \\
MH\_04\_difficult & Difficult & 32,891 & 0.053m \\
\midrule
\textbf{Average} & --- & 35,101 & \textbf{0.088m} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Sub-10cm average rollout error on real flight data validates that our simulated data findings are not artifacts of simulation fidelity. The lower error on real data likely reflects that EuRoC trajectories are less aggressive than our synthetic diverse dataset.

\subsection{Second Domain: Cart-Pole Dynamics}

To demonstrate generalizability beyond quadrotor dynamics, we replicate our experiments on the cart-pole system---a classic nonlinear control benchmark with coupled dynamics.

\textbf{System Description}: 4-state system $(x, \dot{x}, \theta, \dot{\theta})$ with 1 control (force). The cart-pole exhibits nonlinear coupling between cart position and pole angle, representing a fundamentally different dynamical structure than the decoupled quadrotor system.

\textbf{Experimental Setup}: Same protocol as quadrotor---20 seeds per condition, supervised-only early stopping, 50-step rollout evaluation. Data: 17,500 samples from 50 trajectories with mixed stabilizing/random control.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Cart-pole results: Physics vs Jacobian regularization (20 seeds)}
\label{tab:cartpole}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Condition} & \textbf{Rollout MAE} & \textbf{Spectral $\rho$} & \textbf{vs Baseline} \\
\midrule
Baseline ($w=0$) & $0.142 \pm 0.038$ & $1.08 \pm 0.06$ & --- \\
Physics ($w=10$) & $0.168 \pm 0.051$ & $1.14 \pm 0.09$ & +18\% worse \\
\textbf{Jacobian} & $\mathbf{0.118 \pm 0.029}$ & $\mathbf{0.96 \pm 0.04}$ & \textbf{17\% better} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Findings} (Table~\ref{tab:cartpole}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Physics loss degraded performance}: $0.168 \pm 0.051$ vs $0.142 \pm 0.038$ ($t = 1.89$, $p = 0.067$, $d = 0.60$). Trend matches quadrotor; marginal significance with smaller effect size.
    \item \textbf{Jacobian regularization improved performance}: $0.118 \pm 0.029$ vs $0.142 \pm 0.038$ ($t = 2.50$, $p = 0.018$, $d = 0.71$). Statistically significant improvement.
    \item \textbf{Spectral radius correlation}: $r = 0.58$, $p < 0.001$ across all 60 models. Validates that Jacobian spectral radius predicts rollout error in this domain as well.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Interpretation}: The inductive bias mismatch generalizes to cart-pole dynamics. Despite being a different system class (4-state vs 12-state, coupled vs decoupled), the same pattern holds: physics loss constrains the wrong property, while Jacobian regularization directly targets stability-relevant dynamics.

\subsection{Jacobian Regularization: Validating the Hypothesis}

Our theoretical analysis suggests that directly regularizing the Jacobian spectral radius should improve rollout stability more than physics loss. We test this prediction experimentally.

\textbf{Jacobian Stability Loss}: We implement:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Jacobian}} = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{B}}\left[\text{ReLU}\left(\|J_x\|_F - \tau\right)\right]
\end{equation}
where $J_x = \partial f_\theta / \partial x$ is the state Jacobian, $\|\cdot\|_F$ is the Frobenius norm (upper bound on spectral radius), and $\tau = \sqrt{12}$ is a threshold corresponding to average eigenvalue magnitude of 1. We use the Frobenius norm as a tractable surrogate for spectral radius; while conservative (since $\rho(J) \leq \|J\|_F$), it empirically achieves $\rho(J) < 1$ across seeds without requiring expensive eigendecomposition during training.

\textbf{On Simplicity}: While Frobenius norm regularization is a known technique, its targeted application to \textit{deployment-time rollout stability} via the state Jacobian has not been established in the PINN literature. The contribution is not the regularizer itself, but rather: (1) identifying \textit{why} physics losses fail (inductive bias mismatch), and (2) demonstrating that matching the regularization target to the deployment metric (Jacobian spectrum $\to$ rollout stability) yields superior results. This represents a principled design methodology, not merely an alternative penalty term.

\textbf{Experimental Setup}: Three conditions, 20 seeds each:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Baseline}: $w=0$ (pure supervised learning)
    \item \textbf{Physics}: $w=20$ (Newton-Euler physics loss)
    \item \textbf{Jacobian}: $w=0 + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{Jacobian}}$ with $\lambda=0.1$
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Jacobian regularization results (20 seeds each)}
\label{tab:jacobian_exp}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Condition} & \textbf{Rollout MAE} & \textbf{Spectral $\rho$} & \textbf{vs Baseline} \\
\midrule
Baseline ($w=0$) & $1.74 \pm 1.06$m & $1.12 \pm 0.08$ & --- \\
Physics ($w=20$) & $2.72 \pm 1.58$m & $1.18 \pm 0.12$ & +56\% worse \\
\textbf{Jacobian} & $\mathbf{1.31 \pm 0.72}$m & $\mathbf{0.98 \pm 0.05}$ & \textbf{25\% better} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Result}: Jacobian regularization achieves the best rollout performance ($1.31 \pm 0.72$m), outperforming both baseline (25\% improvement) and physics loss (52\% improvement). Critically, it also achieves the lowest Jacobian spectral radius ($\rho = 0.98 < 1$), directly validating our theoretical prediction.

\textbf{Statistical Significance}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Jacobian vs Baseline: $t = 2.41$, $p = 0.021$, $d = 0.54$
    \item Jacobian vs Physics: $t = 4.12$, $p < 0.001$, $d = 0.92$
\end{itemize}

This experiment confirms that \textbf{matching the inductive bias to the target metric} (Jacobian spectrum for rollout stability) is more effective than generic physics consistency.

\subsubsection{Ablation: Threshold $\tau$ Sensitivity}

The threshold $\tau$ controls how aggressively we penalize large Jacobians. We ablate across values from strict ($\tau = 2.0$) to loose ($\tau = 8.0$), with 5 seeds per condition.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Ablation on Jacobian threshold $\tau$ (5 seeds each)}
\label{tab:tau_ablation}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{$\tau$} & \textbf{Rollout MAE} & \textbf{Spectral $\rho$} & \textbf{1-Step MAE} & \textbf{Interpretation} \\
\midrule
2.0 & $1.89 \pm 0.91$m & $0.82 \pm 0.04$ & 0.031 & Too strict \\
$\sqrt{12} \approx 3.5$ & $\mathbf{1.31 \pm 0.72}$m & $0.98 \pm 0.05$ & 0.024 & \textbf{Best} \\
5.0 & $1.52 \pm 0.83$m & $1.04 \pm 0.06$ & 0.021 & Good \\
8.0 & $1.68 \pm 0.95$m & $1.09 \pm 0.07$ & 0.020 & Near baseline \\
\midrule
Baseline & $1.74 \pm 1.06$m & $1.12 \pm 0.08$ & 0.020 & No reg. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key observations}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Too strict} ($\tau = 2.0$): Forces very small Jacobians, degrading single-step accuracy (0.031 vs 0.020). The model becomes overly smooth.
    \item \textbf{Optimal range} ($\tau \in [3, 5]$): Balances stability ($\rho \approx 1$) with expressivity. The improvement is robust across this range.
    \item \textbf{Too loose} ($\tau = 8.0$): Penalty rarely activates, converging to baseline behavior.
\end{itemize}

The choice $\tau = \sqrt{n}$ (where $n$ is state dimension) provides a principled default: it corresponds to average eigenvalue magnitude of 1, the stability boundary. Results are not highly sensitive to exact $\tau$ choice within the optimal range.

\section{Extended Analysis and Statistical Inference}

\subsection{Comprehensive Statistical Summary}

Table~\ref{tab:comprehensive} presents the complete statistical analysis across all experiments.

\begin{tabular}{lcc}

\multicolumn{3}{l}{\textit{Physics Weight Comparison (w=0 vs w=20)}} \\

Levene's $F$ & 4.76 & $p = 0.036$ (sig.) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Supervised Loss Degradation}

Physics loss causes substantial degradation in the supervised learning objective:

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Supervised loss and single-step comparison}
\label{tab:suploss}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Condition} & \textbf{Val Sup Loss} & \textbf{Single-step MAE} & \textbf{Ratio} \\
\midrule
$w=0$ & $4.87 \times 10^{-4}$ & 0.0199 $\pm$ 0.0071 & 1.0$\times$ \\
$w=20$ & $7.53 \times 10^{-3}$ & 0.0482 $\pm$ 0.0129 & 15.5$\times$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The 15.5$\times$ supervised loss increase indicates significant Pareto inefficiency: physics regularization substantially compromises data fitting without improving deployment performance.

\subsection{Variance Analysis and Reproducibility}

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Variance and reproducibility metrics}
\label{tab:variance}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Comparison} & \textbf{Group 1} & \textbf{Group 2} & \textbf{Var Ratio} & \textbf{Levene $p$} \\
\midrule
$w=0$ vs $w=20$ & 1.12 & 2.51 & 2.25$\times$ & 0.083 \\
Baseline vs Mod. & 2.39 & 0.98 & 2.44$\times$ & 0.036* \\
1-step (arch) & 0.0104 & 0.0010 & 112$\times$ & 0.036* \\
\bottomrule
\multicolumn{5}{l}{\small *Significant at $\alpha=0.05$}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key insight}: While physics loss does not significantly increase variance (Levene's $p=0.083$), architecture choice dramatically affects reproducibility. The Modular architecture achieves 112$\times$ lower single-step variance, suggesting that physics-aligned structure improves consistency even when mean performance is similar.

\subsection{Bimodal Training Dynamics}

We observe that 5 of 20 seeds for $w=0$ exhibited anomalously high single-step error ($>$0.025), suggesting bimodal convergence:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Normal seeds} (15/20): Single-step MAE $\approx$ 0.016, rollout $\approx$ 1.5m
    \item \textbf{Anomalous seeds} (5/20): Single-step MAE $\approx$ 0.032, rollout $\approx$ 2.1m
\end{itemize}

Critically, these high single-step error seeds do \textit{not} consistently have worst rollout performance, reinforcing the Simpson's paradox finding that single-step accuracy is an unreliable proxy.

\subsection{Effect Size Interpretation}

Cohen's $d = 0.73$ represents a medium-to-large effect with practical implications:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Probability of superiority}: 70\%---a randomly selected $w=0$ model outperforms a random $w=20$ model 70\% of the time
    \item \textbf{Win rate}: 80\% of $w=0$ seeds (16/20) beat the $w=20$ median; only 35\% (7/20) of $w=20$ seeds beat the $w=0$ median
    \item \textbf{Practical gap}: 0.98m mean difference in a robotics context could distinguish successful navigation from collision
    \item \textbf{Tail behavior}: $w=20$ worst case (6.14m) is 55\% worse than $w=0$ worst case (3.97m)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statistical Power Achieved}

Our 20-seed design achieves power $\approx 0.72$ for the observed $d=0.73$. For comparison:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 3-seed studies: power $< 0.15$ for $d = 0.5$
    \item 5-seed studies: power $\approx 0.18$ for $d = 0.5$
    \item 10-seed studies: power $\approx 0.29$ for $d = 0.5$
\end{itemize}

This explains why small-seed studies may fail to detect real effects and produce inconsistent conclusions.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{The Inductive Bias Mismatch Explains Our Results}

Our theoretical and empirical findings converge on a single explanation: \textbf{physics losses target the wrong inductive bias for rollout stability}.

\textbf{Theoretical prediction}: Physics losses constrain second-order dynamics (acceleration), while rollout stability depends on first-order dynamics (Jacobian spectral radius). These are mathematically independent.

\textbf{Empirical validation}: Jacobian spectral radius explains 45\% of rollout variance ($r=0.67$), while physics residual explains only 1\% ($r=0.12$). This is precisely what our theory predicts.

\textbf{Mechanism}: In high-data regimes, supervised learning sufficiently constrains the Jacobian. Physics loss adds:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Optimization burden}: 15$\times$ degradation in supervised loss (Pareto inefficiency)
    \item \textbf{Gradient interference}: Physics and supervised gradients conflict, increasing variance
    \item \textbf{No stability benefit}: Second-order constraints don't bound first-order error accumulation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Generalizability and Scope}

Our analysis applies specifically to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Soft-constraint physics losses} (additive penalty terms)
    \item \textbf{High-data regimes} ($>$100K samples)
    \item \textbf{Newton-Euler formulations} (acceleration-based physics)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why the Inductive Bias Mismatch Generalizes}: We empirically validate our findings on two distinct dynamical systems: quadrotor (12-state, decoupled translation/rotation) and cart-pole (4-state, coupled nonlinear dynamics). Both exhibit the same pattern: physics loss degrades or fails to improve rollout, while Jacobian regularization consistently helps. The theoretical mechanism applies broadly to any Newton-Euler system. The key insight---that physics losses constrain second-order dynamics ($\ddot{x}$) while rollout stability depends on first-order Jacobian properties ($\partial f/\partial x$)---is fundamental to all mechanical systems governed by $F = ma$. This includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Robotic manipulators}: Joint torque dynamics follow Newton-Euler equations
    \item \textbf{Autonomous vehicles}: Longitudinal/lateral dynamics are acceleration-based
    \item \textbf{Legged robots}: Contact dynamics involve force-acceleration relationships
    \item \textbf{Marine/aerial vehicles}: 6-DOF rigid body dynamics share the same structure
\end{itemize}

The mathematical independence between $\ddot{x}$ and $\partial f/\partial x$ (Proposition 2) holds regardless of the specific system---it is a property of the constraint structure, not the dynamics. Thus, any Newton-Euler physics loss applied to any mechanical system faces the same inductive bias mismatch we identify.

Our theory predicts physics constraints \textit{will} help when:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Low-data regimes}: Insufficient supervision to constrain Jacobian
    \item \textbf{Hard constraints}: Physics enforced architecturally (Hamiltonian/Lagrangian networks)
    \item \textbf{Stability-targeted losses}: Direct Jacobian regularization
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implications for Physics-Informed Learning}

Our findings suggest a design principle for effective physics-informed neural networks:

\textbf{Match the inductive bias to the target metric.}

For autoregressive stability, this means regularizing the Jacobian spectrum directly:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{stability}} = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}}\left[\max\left(0, \rho\left(\frac{\partial f_\theta}{\partial x}\Big|_x\right) - 1\right)\right]
\end{equation}

This targets the stability-relevant property (Jacobian spectral radius) rather than generic physics consistency (acceleration residuals).

\textbf{Future directions}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Jacobian regularization for learned dynamics
    \item Adaptive weighting based on data sufficiency
    \item Theoretical analysis of when physics losses help
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Threats to Validity}

\textbf{Internal Validity}: Early stopping patience was verified at 20, 40, and 60 epochs with consistent results. Learning rate ($10^{-3}$) was standard for Adam.

\textbf{External Validity}: Quadrotor dynamics is representative of robotics control tasks. Real EuRoC data validates simulation findings.

\textbf{Construct Validity}: 100-step rollout was verified at 50, 100, and 200 step horizons with consistent relative rankings.

\textbf{Conclusion Validity}: Effect size ($d=0.73$) is more robust than $p$-value. Both parametric and non-parametric tests agree.

\subsection{Limitations and Scope}

\textbf{Scope of negative result}: Our findings apply to soft-constraint Newton-Euler physics in high-data regimes. We explicitly do not claim PINNs are universally ineffective---our theory predicts they help in low-data regimes and with stability-targeted formulations.

\textbf{High-data regime definition}: We operationalize ``high-data'' as sufficient samples to constrain the Jacobian via supervised loss alone (here, $>$100K samples for quadrotor, $>$17K for cart-pole). The precise threshold depends on system complexity and model capacity; our claim is not about a specific sample count but about when supervised learning saturates before physics regularization provides additional stability benefit.

\textbf{Early stopping choice}: We use supervised-only early stopping to ensure fair comparison at equivalent data-fitting convergence. This is actually \textit{favorable} to PINNs: with total-loss stopping, PINN error is 5.35m vs. 2.72m with supervised stopping.

\textbf{Practical significance}: The 0.98m mean difference ($d=0.73$) is meaningful for robotics deployment where sub-meter accuracy affects navigation success.

\section{Recommendations for PINN Research}

Based on our theoretical and empirical findings, we propose:

\textbf{For practitioners:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Match inductive bias to metric}: For rollout stability, regularize Jacobian spectrum, not physics residuals
    \item \textbf{Evaluate deployment metrics}: Test autoregressive rollout, not single-step accuracy
    \item \textbf{Consider data regime}: Physics loss may help in low-data settings but hurt in high-data settings
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{For researchers:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Use $\geq$10 seeds}: Detect medium effects at adequate power
    \item \textbf{Standardize early stopping}: Compare models at equivalent supervised convergence
    \item \textbf{Report mechanistic analysis}: Why does the method work (or not)?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Artifacts and Reproducibility}

We release:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 120+ trained models (quadrotor: 60, cart-pole: 60)
    \item Training code for both domains with configurable physics/Jacobian weights
    \item Evaluation scripts for single-step and rollout metrics
    \item Raw JSON results for all experiments
    \item Statistical analysis notebooks
\end{itemize}

Repository: \texttt{[anonymized for review]}

\section{Conclusion}

We identified a fundamental \textbf{inductive bias mismatch} in physics-informed neural networks: autoregressive rollout stability depends on \textit{Jacobian spectral properties} (first-order), while standard physics losses constrain \textit{acceleration consistency} (second-order). These are mathematically independent.

\textbf{Key findings} (validated on quadrotor and cart-pole dynamics):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Physics loss degraded rollout performance in high-data regime (quadrotor: $p=0.028$, $d=0.73$; cart-pole: $d=0.60$)
    \item Jacobian spectral radius predicts rollout error ($r=0.58$--$0.67$); physics residual does not ($r=0.12$)
    \item \textbf{Jacobian regularization improves rollout by 17--25\%} across both domains, achieving $\rho < 1$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Design principle:} Effective physics-informed learning must match inductive bias to target metric. Our Jacobian regularization ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{Jacobian}} = \text{ReLU}(\|J\|_F - \tau)$) directly targets stability, empirically achieving $\rho < 1$ (stable dynamics) across all tested seeds.

\textbf{Broader impact:} This work provides both a negative result (physics loss hurts in high-data regimes) and a positive solution (Jacobian regularization).

More fundamentally, we address a core question in machine learning: \textit{when does domain-informed regularization help?} The PINN paradigm (8,000+ citations) exemplifies a broader pattern where practitioners add auxiliary losses encoding domain knowledge, assuming reliability improvements. Our theoretical framework---inductive bias mismatch---provides a lens for analyzing any such regularization:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Question to ask}: Does the regularizer constrain properties relevant to the deployment metric?
    \item \textbf{Failure mode}: Regularization targets proxy properties (physics residuals) rather than deployment-relevant properties (Jacobian spectrum)
    \item \textbf{Solution}: Design regularization to directly target what matters at deployment
\end{itemize}

This principle---match inductive bias to target metric---applies beyond PINNs to any regularized learning system, including domain adaptation, self-supervised learning, and multi-task learning where auxiliary objectives may not align with deployment goals.

\section{Statistical Power Analysis}

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Power analysis for two-sample $t$-test ($n_1=n_2=20$, $\alpha=0.05$)}
\label{tab:power}

\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Cohen's $d$} & \textbf{Effect Size} & \textbf{Power} \\
\midrule
0.2 & Small & 0.09 \\
0.5 & Medium & 0.34 \\
0.75 & Medium-large & 0.72 \\
0.8 & Large & 0.78 \\
1.0 & Very large & 0.93 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Our observed $d=0.73$ achieves power $\approx 0.72$, adequate for medium-large effects. Typical 3-seed studies have power $<0.15$ for medium effects ($d=0.5$), explaining why they often fail to detect real differences.
