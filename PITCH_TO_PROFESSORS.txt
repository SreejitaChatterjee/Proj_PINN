"I've been working on using Physics-Informed Neural Networks to learn quadrotor
dynamics. I have some preliminary results showing that how you structure the
neural network matters a lot for long-horizon prediction stability. I'd like
your guidance on whether this direction is worth pursuing and what would make
it publishable."

================================================================================
                              WHAT I BUILT
================================================================================

A PINN that:
- Learns 12-state quadrotor dynamics from simulation data
- Enforces Newton-Euler physics constraints during training
- Identifies 6 physical parameters (mass, inertias, motor coefficients)

System: 6-DOF quadrotor with state x = [x, y, z, phi, theta, psi, p, q, r, vx, vy, vz]
Training data: 10 trajectories, 49,382 samples at 1kHz

================================================================================
                           THE KEY RESULT
================================================================================

Architecture              100-Step Error       Parameters
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Baseline (monolithic)     5.09 m               205K
Fourier features          5.09 m               302K
Curriculum training       4.36 m               205K
Modular (trans/rot)       1.11 m               72K      <-- BEST

KEY FINDING: Splitting the network into translation and rotation subnetworks
gives 4.6x better stability with 65% fewer parameters.

================================================================================
                     THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTION
                  (From ACC/CDC Paper Draft)
================================================================================

1. STABILITY ENVELOPE FRAMEWORK

   I introduce a formal metric for autoregressive stability:

   H_epsilon = max{ K : E[||x_hat_{t+K} - x_{t+K}||] < epsilon }

   This captures the maximum prediction horizon where error remains bounded.
   For control (MPC), we need H_epsilon >= MPC_horizon.

2. LIPSCHITZ STABILITY BOUND

   If the learned model g_phi has Lipschitz constant L:
   - If L < 1: errors contract, H_epsilon is large
   - If L > 1: errors grow exponentially, H_epsilon is bounded

   This explains WHY architecture matters for stability.

================================================================================
                      COUNTER-INTUITIVE FINDING
                    (From ICRA Paper Draft)
================================================================================

Quadrotor dynamics have STRONG physical coupling:

   ddot{z} = -T*cos(theta)*cos(phi)/m + g

Vertical acceleration depends directly on attitude angles. The INTUITION is
that a monolithic network should capture this coupling better.

BUT the data shows the OPPOSITE:
- Modular (separate trans/rot): 1.11m error at 100 steps
- Monolithic (coupled):         5.09m error at 100 steps

HYPOTHESIS: The modular architecture provides beneficial inductive bias by:
- Preventing gradient interference between subsystems
- Implicitly regularizing through architectural constraints
- Reducing parameter count (72K vs 205K)

================================================================================
                     WHAT DOESN'T WORK
                  (From NeurIPS Paper Draft)
================================================================================

1. FOURIER FEATURES
   - Popular in NeRF and implicit representations
   - Provides ZERO benefit here (5.09m vs 5.09m baseline)
   - Uses 48% MORE parameters (302K vs 205K)

2. CURRICULUM TRAINING
   - Progressive extension of rollout horizon
   - Only 14% improvement (4.36m vs 5.09m)
   - Not enough to match modular architecture

================================================================================
                        PARAMETER IDENTIFICATION
================================================================================

The PINN also identifies physical parameters:

Parameter          Error Rate    Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Motor coeff (kt)   0%            Perfectly identifiable
Torque coeff (kq)  0%            Perfectly identifiable
Mass (m)           7.7% (mod)    Better with modular
                   40% (base)    Worse with baseline
Inertias (J)       50-60%        Observability limited at small angles

================================================================================
                     WHAT I DON'T HAVE (BEING HONEST)
================================================================================

- No rigorous proof for WHY modular works (empirical observation)
- No hardware validation (simulation only)
- Not tested in actual MPC control loop
- Not compared to traditional system ID (Kalman, particle filters)

================================================================================
                           QUESTIONS FOR YOU
================================================================================

1. Is this direction worth pursuing?
   The modular result is solid but may be seen as incremental.

2. What would make this publishable?
   - Theoretical analysis of why modular helps?
   - Hardware validation on a real quadrotor (Crazyflie)?
   - Integration with MPC and comparison to baselines?

3. What problems in your research could learned dynamics help with?
   I'd rather work on something useful to your lab than publish weak
   standalone work.

================================================================================
                       SPECIFIC FOR PROF. KANDATH
================================================================================

Your work on UAV control and MPC is directly relevant. Questions:

- Do you use learned models in your MPC implementations?
- What are the pain points with traditional system identification?
- Would a learned dynamics model stable for 100+ steps be useful?

Potential synergy:
- I provide learned dynamics model
- You provide MPC framework and hardware platform
- Joint paper on "Learned Dynamics for Quadrotor MPC"

================================================================================
                        SPECIFIC FOR PROF. VINOD PK
================================================================================

Your work on nonlinear dynamics and computational methods could connect:

- Is there interest in physics-informed learning for biological systems?
- The modular architecture idea could apply to other coupled dynamical systems
- Stability envelope framework is general (not quadrotor-specific)

Based on what I have, realistic venues are:

VENUE              WHAT'S NEEDED                           DIFFICULTY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ICRA Workshop      Current results + polish                Low
RA-L               Hardware validation                     Medium
ACC/CDC            Stronger theoretical analysis           Medium-High
ICRA Full          MPC integration + hardware              Medium-High
NeurIPS/ICML       Breakthrough finding                    Unlikely

================================================================================
                          WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR
================================================================================

1. FEEDBACK on whether this has potential
2. GUIDANCE on what experiments would strengthen it
3. POTENTIAL COLLABORATION or thesis supervision if interested

================================================================================
                          HONEST ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

This is SOLID PRELIMINARY WORK, not a breakthrough.

The modular architecture result is real and reproducible:
- 4.6x better 100-step stability (1.11m vs 5.09m)
- 65% fewer parameters (72K vs 205K)

But I need guidance on:
1. What venue is realistic given current state
2. What additional experiments are needed
3. Whether to pivot to a different angle

I'd rather get honest feedback now than waste time on something that
won't be impactful.
