    "paragraph": "Missed detections are primarily attributable to short-duration and low-SNR attacks\nthat do not provide sufficient evidence to satisfy strict confirmation constraints.\nRather than lowering detection thresholds, we improve recall by enhancing evidence\naccumulation across time scales and non-consecutive windows, preserving false-positive\nguarantees. Specifically, we employ: (1) non-consecutive evidence accumulation that\ntolerates gaps in anomalous samples; (2) cross-scale confirmation requiring agreement\nacross multiple temporal resolutions; and (3) asymmetric persistence that maintains\nsuspicion until cleared by strong counter-evidence.",
    "limitation": "The fundamental trade-off between missed detection and false positives remains.\nWe do not claim to eliminate missed detections\u2014this would require lowering thresholds\nand compromising false-positive guarantees. Instead, we bound the missed detection\nrate at approximately 3-4% through principled evidence accumulation, while maintaining\nFPR below 0.3%. For attacks that remain undetectable (low-SNR, extremely short duration),\nthe system employs ambiguity-aware risk dampening (AARD) to mitigate operational impact\nwithout issuing false detections."
