PINN-RESIDUAL APPROACH: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS OF FAILURE
================================================================================

HYPOTHESIS (Original):
- PINN learns physics, attacks violate physics -> detectable residuals
- Bias attacks should cause physics violations (attitude doesn't match rates)

ACTUAL RESULTS:
- Overall Recall: 11.2% (WORSE than raw features: 22.7%)
- Bias Recall: 0.1% (WORSE than raw features: 3.1%)
- FPR: 14.0% (WORSE than raw features: 6.5%)

================================================================================
WHY THE HYPOTHESIS WAS FLAWED
================================================================================

The PINN-residual approach fails because:

1. CONSISTENT ATTACK PROBLEM:
   - Bias is applied to the ENTIRE sequence
   - Both input (state_t) and "ground truth" (state_{t+1}) are biased
   - Residual = biased_actual - PINN(biased_input)
   - If PINN generalizes to shifted operating points, residual stays small

2. PINN IS NOT A PHYSICS CHECKER:
   - PINN learns: f(state_t) -> state_{t+1}
   - This is a LEARNED MAPPING, not physics constraint checking
   - It doesn't verify: "Is this state physically plausible?"
   - It only predicts: "Given this input, what comes next?"

3. NO CROSS-MODAL VALIDATION:
   - True physics checking requires: comparing INDEPENDENT measurements
   - Example: integrate accelerometer -> compare to GPS position
   - Our PINN only uses one data stream (self-consistency check)
   - Self-consistency can't detect systematic bias

4. RESIDUAL FEATURES ARE SECOND-ORDER:
   - We extract features from residuals, then detect anomalies
   - This adds another layer of indirection
   - Small residuals -> small features -> undetectable

================================================================================
WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK FOR BIAS DETECTION
================================================================================

1. SENSOR FUSION (Cross-Modal Validation):
   - Compare IMU-integrated position to GPS position
   - Compare visual odometry to IMU measurements
   - Discrepancy indicates attack/fault

2. REDUNDANT SENSORS:
   - Multiple IMUs with voting
   - Gyro + accelerometer cross-check
   - Requires hardware redundancy

3. KNOWN PHYSICS MODEL (Not Learned):
   - Use analytical dynamics: integrate F=ma
   - Compare predicted vs measured
   - But: requires accurate model parameters

4. CUMULATIVE SUM (CUSUM):
   - Detect persistent bias via cumulative errors
   - Works for slowly-drifting attacks
   - Need: trusted reference signal

================================================================================
HONEST CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The PINN-residual approach DOES NOT improve bias detection.
The fundamental limitation is:
- Single-sensor data cannot detect systematic bias
- Bias affects both input and "ground truth" consistently
- Only cross-modal or redundant sensors can detect bias

RECOMMENDATION:
- For statistical anomalies (noise, spikes): Raw multi-scale features work
- For systematic bias: Need additional sensor modalities or redundancy
- Do NOT claim PINN-based approaches detect bias without validation

noise                60.1%           9.5%         Raw Features
bias                  3.1%           0.1%         Raw Features

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall              22.7%          11.2%         Raw Features
FPR                   6.5%          14.0%         Raw Features

VERDICT: PINN-residual approach is INFERIOR to simple raw features.
