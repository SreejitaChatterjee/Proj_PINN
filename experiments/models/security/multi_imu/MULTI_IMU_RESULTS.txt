MULTI-IMU REDUNDANCY DETECTION RESULTS
================================================================================

METHODOLOGY:
PADRE dataset has 4 IMUs (one per motor arm).
Cross-IMU consistency checking detects when ONE sensor deviates from consensus.

RESULTS:

Real Motor Faults: 20.3% recall (actual hardware faults)

Synthetic Single-IMU Attacks:
  bias (accel):         67.5%
  bias (gyro):          68.3%
  noise:                74.3%
  scale:                67.8%
  coordinated (all):    51.1%

Average Single-IMU Attack: 69.5%

COMPARISON:
                        EuRoC Sensor Fusion    PADRE Multi-IMU
  Bias Recall:                36.2%              69.5%
  Coordinated Attack:         14.8%              51.1%

KEY INSIGHT:
Sensor redundancy (multiple IMUs) enables bias detection that is
impossible with single-sensor approaches.
