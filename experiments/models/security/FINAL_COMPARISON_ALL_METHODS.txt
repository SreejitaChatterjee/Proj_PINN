DETAILED RESULTS BY METHOD
================================================================================

1. RAW MULTI-SCALE FEATURES (Baseline)
--------------------------------------
- Extracts statistical features at multiple time windows
- Trains IsolationForest for anomaly detection
- Works for: High-variance attacks (noise, drift)
- Fails for: Constant offsets (bias)
- Cross-dataset: 3.3% recall (very poor)

Per-attack (EuRoC, LOSO-CV):
  noise:       60.1%
  drift:       51.9%
  jump:        20.9%
  oscillation:  3.7%
  bias:         3.1%


2. PINN-RESIDUAL FEATURES (Failed Approach)
-------------------------------------------
- Use PINN to predict next state, detect physics violations
- HYPOTHESIS: Attacks violate physics -> residual spikes
- REALITY: Consistent attacks don't create residuals

Why it failed:
- Bias applied to ENTIRE sequence (input AND "ground truth")
- PINN learns mapping, not physics constraints
- Self-consistency cannot detect systematic bias

Per-attack (EuRoC, LOSO-CV):
  noise:        9.5%
  drift:       29.4%
  jump:        14.4%
  oscillation:  2.7%
  bias:         0.1%  <- WORSE than baseline!


3. SENSOR FUSION (Cross-Modal Consistency)
------------------------------------------
- Exploits kinematic constraints:
  * d(attitude)/dt should match angular rates
  * d(velocity)/dt should match accelerations
  * d(position)/dt should match velocities
- Bias on ONE modality creates inconsistency

Per-attack (EuRoC, LOSO-CV):
  bias_velocity:    100.0%  <- Very effective!
  noise:            100.0%
  bias_rates:        15.3%
  bias_attitude:     14.8%
  bias_position:     14.8%
  coordinated:       14.8%

Key insight: Works when attack affects one sensor but not its derivative.


4. MULTI-IMU REDUNDANCY (PADRE Dataset)
---------------------------------------
- Uses 4 IMUs (one per motor arm) for consensus
- Detects when ONE sensor deviates from others
- True sensor redundancy approach

Real motor faults: 20.3% recall (actual hardware faults from PADRE)

Synthetic single-IMU attacks:
  bias (accel):       67.5%
  bias (gyro):        68.3%
  noise:              74.3%
  scale:              67.8%
  coordinated (all):  51.1%

Average Single-IMU Attack: 69.5%

KEY IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

                        Baseline    Sensor Fusion    Multi-IMU
Bias Detection:           3.1%         36.2%          67.9%
Improvement:               -           11.7x          21.9x

================================================================================
KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. BIAS DETECTION REQUIRES REDUNDANCY
   - Single-sensor approaches cannot reliably detect bias (3.1%)
   - Sensor fusion: 36.2% (11.7x improvement)
   - Multi-IMU: 67.9% (21.9x improvement)

2. MULTI-IMU IS MOST EFFECTIVE
   - 4 redundant sensors enable voting/consensus
   - Even coordinated attacks detected at 51.1%
   - Best approach when hardware supports it

3. SOPHISTICATED ATTACKS REMAIN CHALLENGING
   - Coordinated attacks: 14.8% (sensor fusion) to 51.1% (multi-IMU)
   - Still not 100% - fundamental limitation
   - Would require external reference (GPS, visual odometry)

4. PINN APPROACH DOES NOT WORK
   - Learned mappings ≠ physics constraint checking
   - Self-consistency cannot detect systematic bias
   - Don't pursue this direction further

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRODUCTION
================================================================================

1. BEST: Use MULTI-IMU CONSENSUS if platform has redundant sensors
   - 69.5% single-sensor attack detection
   - 51.1% even for coordinated attacks
   - Works on real hardware faults

2. ALTERNATIVE: Use SENSOR FUSION for single-IMU platforms
   - 36.2% bias detection
   - 49.0% overall recall
   - Exploits kinematic constraints

3. COMBINE APPROACHES for defense in depth
   - Raw features for noise/drift detection
   - Sensor fusion for bias detection
   - Multi-IMU for single-sensor compromise

4. ACCEPT LIMITATIONS
   - Perfect detection requires external reference
   - No silver bullet without GPS/visual odometry
