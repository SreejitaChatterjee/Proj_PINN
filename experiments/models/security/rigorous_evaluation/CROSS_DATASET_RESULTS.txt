CROSS-DATASET TRANSFER TEST RESULTS
============================================================

Methodology:
- Trained: EuRoC normal data (138K samples)
- Tested: PADRE dataset (different drone platforms)
- Feature conversion: Aggregated per-motor IMU to 12D features

Results:
- FPR on PADRE Normal: 0.0% +/- 0.0%
- Recall on PADRE Faults: 3.3% +/- 5.9%

Interpretation:
- The detector trained on EuRoC does NOT generalize well to PADRE
- This is EXPECTED: different platforms have different dynamics
- Cross-dataset validation is a critical honest limitation

Recommendation:
- Do NOT claim generalization across platforms without validation
- Detector must be retrained or fine-tuned for each platform
