ANOMALY RESOLUTION VERIFICATION
================================

Date: November 4, 2025

1. DATA SCALING MISMATCH (CRITICAL) - ✓ RESOLVED
--------------------------------------------------
Before:
- Training used StandardScaler, evaluation didn't
- Prediction errors: 143-1767% relative error
- Model received raw unscaled data during evaluation

After:
- Scalers saved during training: models/scalers.pkl (1.4KB)
- Evaluation loads and applies scalers correctly
- Reasonable error metrics:
  * z: MAE=0.60m, RMSE=0.80m
  * Angles: MAE=0.002-0.004 rad, RMSE=0.003-0.005 rad
  * Angular rates: MAE=0.39-0.91 rad/s, RMSE=0.69-1.54 rad/s
  * vz: MAE=1.15 m/s, RMSE=1.45 m/s

Status: ✓ FIXED - Evaluation now uses proper scaling

2. MAPE CALCULATION ISSUE (HIGH) - ⚠ KNOWN ISSUE
--------------------------------------------------
Before:
- MAPE used 1e-8 denominator
- Division by near-zero → astronomical percentages

After:
- MAPE still shows high values (33M% for z)
- However, MAE and RMSE are now physically reasonable
- MAPE is unreliable for values near zero

Status: ⚠ KNOWN ISSUE - MAPE not reliable, use MAE/RMSE instead

3. EVALUATION ON INITIAL CONDITIONS (MEDIUM) - ⚠ NOT ADDRESSED
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Still evaluating on full dataset including transients
- Could be improved but not critical

Status: ⚠ FUTURE IMPROVEMENT

MODEL PARAMETERS
----------------
Learned parameters remain good:
- kt, kq: 0.0% error (perfect)
- m: 0.0% error (near perfect)
- Jxx, Jyy, Jzz: 15.0% error (acceptable)

CONCLUSION
----------
✓ Critical scaling mismatch RESOLVED
✓ Model produces reasonable predictions
✓ Evaluation metrics are now meaningful (MAE/RMSE)
⚠ MAPE remains unreliable (use MAE/RMSE instead)

The primary anomaly has been successfully resolved!
